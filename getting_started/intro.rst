Introduction
==================

Here is where you will find all the information needed to get started and join the F1TENTH community! This build documentation is divided into four sequential sections, each one building on the other:

#. :ref:`Building the Car <doc_build_car>` - Start here if you are building the car from scratch.
#. :ref:`System Configuration <doc_software_setup>`- Start here if you have completed building the car.
#. :ref:`Installing Firmware <doc_build_car_firmware>` - Start here if you've already done 1 and 2 above.
#. :ref:`Driving the Car <doc_drive>` - Start here if you have everything set up from the previous three sections and are ready to learn how to set up a workspace on the vehicle and start driving!

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate-Advanced

**Overall Approximate Time Investment:** 10-15 hours

You might want to plan on saving an entire day to work on this project if you going through this Getting Started section from beginning to end.
