F1TENTH - Build Documentation
================================================

Welcome to the official build documentation of `F1TENTH <http://f1tenth.org/>`_.

.. attention::
  #. If you are new to F1TENTH, :ref:`Getting Started <doc_build_intro>` is a good place to start.

  #. If you already have a working car and the work environment set up:

 	- Head over to `Learn <https://f1tenth.org/learn.html>`_ and try out some of the **Labs**.
  	- Check out :ref:`Going Forward <doc_going_forward_intro>` to learn how to install the simulator and implement some fun algorithms.

  #. If you don't want to build a physical car and just want to play around in the simulator, head straight to :ref:`Simulation <doc_going_forward_simulation>`.
